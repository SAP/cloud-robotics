# ðŸ¤–  Cloud Robotics ðŸ¤– 

This Cloud Robotics version is our adaption of the open source
[Google Cloud Robotics](https://github.com/googlecloudrobotics/core) platform that provides
infrastructure essential to building and running robotics solutions for business
automation. Cloud Robotics Core makes managing robot fleets easy for developers,
integrators, and operators. It enables:

* packaging and distribution of applications
* secure, bidirectional robot-cloud communication
* easy integration into SAP BTP Kyma infrastructure.

We consider it as a friendly fork of Google Cloud Robotics and try to keep it as close as possible to it. However there are some differences:
- This version does not Google Cloud Platform services
- We introduced multi-tenancy features
- Some components we did not use have been removed
- There are docker builds instead of bazel
- Cluster provisiong is separated from deployment of Cloud Robotics. In fact there is no automated cluster provisioning at the moment.
